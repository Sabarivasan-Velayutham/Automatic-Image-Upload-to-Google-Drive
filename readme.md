# Automatic Image Upload to Google Drive

This Node.js application watches a specific folder on your local system and automatically uploads any new images to a specified folder on your Google Drive account. It uses the `chokidar` library to monitor the folder for changes and `Google Drive API` for cloud interaction.

## Setup

1. **Folder to Watch**: Specify the folder you want the application to watch. This folder will be monitored for new images to upload.
   
2. **Google Drive Folder ID**: Replace the placeholder folder ID in the code with the ID of your Google Drive folder where you want to upload images.

5. **Credentials**: Obtain and add your own `cred.json` file in the project directory. This file contains OAuth 2.0 credentials to interact with Google Drive.

6. **Error Logging**: Error logging functionality is included to log and display any errors during the upload process.

### Obtaining Google Cloud Credentials

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/).
2. Enable the [Google Drive API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/drive.googleapis.com).
3. Create a service account and generate a `cred.json` file.
4. Save the `cred.json` file in your project directory.

## Google Drive Permissions

1. **Manage Folder Permissions**:
    - Share the Google Drive folder with the email associated with your API client.
    - Add your API email to the folder with necessary permissions as an editor.
  
2. **IAM and Admin Permissions**:
    - Go to the IAM and Admin section.
    - Add the service account with appropriate permissions to your requested users.
